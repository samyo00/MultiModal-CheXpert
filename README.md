# MultiModal-CheXpert
ðŸš€ This project develops a multimodal AI for chest X-ray classification by integrating image features (CNN/Vision Transformers) with radiology reports (BERT/BioBERT). Inspired by generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL), we use feature disentanglement to enhance multi-label disease classification on the CheXpert dataset. ðŸ©»
